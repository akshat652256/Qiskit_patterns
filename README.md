# LangGraph Qiskit Code Generator
This project uses LangChain, LangGraph, and Groq's llama-3.1-8b-instant to generate and iteratively improve Qiskit code for quantum machine learning problems.

-Set up dependencies from requirements.txt

-Set up API keys on the .env file

--MAIN COMPONENTS

i) Interactive Loop: Uses a directed multistep workflow (via LangGraph/LangChain) allowing back-and-forth between the AI code generator and human feedback before execution.

ii) Code Generation: AI model generates Qiskit code for quantum (QSVR, QSVC) and classical tasks, considering problem statement and latest feedback.

iii) Code Execution: Safely executes the latest suggested code, capturing output and errors.

iv) Human Feedback: After each code generation/execution, the user can provide refinements or proceed to execution.

v) Configurable AI Models: Uses LLMs (Groq, OpenAI, etc.) for code generation; can be updated according to API keys and preferences.

--HOW TO USE

i) Start:
You will be prompted for a problem statement (e.g., "Implement quantum SVR on California housing").

ii) AI Suggests Code:
The notebook displays code generated by the language model that fits your problem.

iii) Human Feedback Loop:
You can provide feedback (e.g., "reduce samples", "add PCA", "increase iterations", "fix error"), or type done to proceed to code execution, or exit to stop the process. After every feedback, the model re-generates the code with your instructions incorporated.

iv) Execute or Iterate:
After entering done, the notebook executes the last version of the generated code and displays the output and any errors.
You can resume the feedback cycle until youâ€™re satisfied with the result or end the workflow.

NOTE:
All code snippets include the required Qiskit and sklearn imports.
You can interrupt the process at any time with exit.
